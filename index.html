                        In 2019, we got engaged, marking the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. Our joy multiplied when
                        we welcomed our precious daughter, Lily, into the world on January 31, 2022.
                        Now, we are excited to invite you to celebrate our wedding in Krakow, Magda's beloved hometown, on the 21st of September 2024.

                    Polish Wedding Traditions
                </h2>
                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-stories">    Church Ceremony </h3>

                    <p class="paragraph--u3 u-margin-bottom-small heading-tertiary-stories">The church service at the Church of Saint Anne, a beautiful 13th-century Roman Catholic church, will last approximately one hour. The ceremony will be conducted in both Polish and English, reflecting our cultural backgrounds. </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-stories">Wedding Rituals</h3>

                    <p class="paragraph--u3 u-margin-bottom-small heading-tertiary-stories">After the ceremony, the newly-wed couple will exit the church as husband and wife. This moment is often accompanied by the throwing of rice, although in Poland, guests traditionally shower the couple with coins. This custom stems from the tradition of throwing grain at the couple to ensure a prosperous future. The coins symbolize wishes for a successful and prosperous marriage. Guests then pay their respects to the couple, giving kisses and flowers to the bride and envelopes stuffed with money to the groom. The best man takes charge of the money, while the bridesmaid takes care of the flowers. </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-stories">Reception Traditions</h3>

                    <p class="paragraph--u3 u-margin-bottom-small heading-tertiary-stories">At the reception, all guests will receive a drink upon arrival, while the newly-weds will be presented with bread and salt. Bread symbolizes the hope that they will never know hunger, while salt suggests they may have periods of difficulty in the future and they must learn to deal with life’s problems. Salt also has power over evil spirits and other hazards and is a substance known to cleanse and heal. Following the bread and salt ceremony, the couple traditionally has their first toast. After their drink, the couple throw their glasses; if they break, it's considered a sign of good luck. </p>

                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-stories">Traditional Song and Meal</h3>

                    <p class="paragraph--u3 u-margin-bottom-small heading-tertiary-stories">A traditional song now ensues. It is Sto lat (One Hundred Years) and is a song also heard at birthday celebrations. The wedding party now sits down to their first meal, after which the newly-weds take to the dance floor for their first dance as a married couple. According to current wedding guides, for a standard wedding lasting about 12 hours, there are typically served between four and five hot entrées, along with appetisers, pastries, cake and fruit. So if you finish your first meal and think it wasn’t too filling, just wait… there’s a lot more to come. The same wedding guide suggests a hot meal be served approximately every three hours. Of course, all the drink and food are provided free to guests. All that food will be washed down with a seemingly endless supply of drink. The most popular beverage (as one might suspect) is vodka – and it flows freely throughout the night. The gathering may spontaneously raise their glasses and start chanting ‘Gorzko, gorzko!‘, meaning ‘Bitter, bitter!’ in order to demand a kiss from the groom and bride – in other words, to ask for some sugar.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary-stories"> Oczepiny Ceremony </h3>

                    <p class="paragraph--u3 u-margin-bottom-small heading-tertiary-stories">Where many weddings would be winding down as midnight approaches, a Polish wedding is just approaching one of its most traditional moments – the removal of the bridal veil. This ceremony, called ‘oczepiny’, traditionally represented the transitional moment for the bride as she moved from her single youth towards her married future. The details of the ceremony have changed significantly over the years, but it remains a memorable moment in many contemporary Polish weddings. Oczepiny has become a time for fun and games. The bride removes her veil and tosses it into a gathered crowd of single women. The groom also gets in on the fun – removing and throwing his tie to the assembled male guests. It's said that those who catch the tossed garments will be the next to marry (though not necessarily to each other). After the removal of the veil and tie, the bride and groom might choose to play a number of games. The character of these games can vary – some couples play a little trivia game about one another. Other options involve guests in silly competitions or bawdy scavenger hunts. This traditional ritual has become a playful moment in contemporary Polish weddings.</p>
